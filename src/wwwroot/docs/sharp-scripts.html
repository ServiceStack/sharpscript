The [web .NET Core tool](https://docs.servicestack.net/web-new) also serve as a `#Script` runner. The Vue and React "lite" project templates
take advantage of this in their [Pre-compiled minified production _bundle.ss script](https://docs.servicestack.net/templates-lite#pre-compiled-minified-production-bundles) 
which is run with `web run {script}`:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/10.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
Which can be run with the `web` tool:

    $ dotnet tool install --global web 

    $ web run wwwroot/_bundle.ss

Which will create the production bundles, minify all already non-minified bundles and write them to disk with the paths written visible in the 
`#Script` *_bundle.ss* output:

**[Sharp Scripts](/docs/sharp-scripts)** are **run in the same context** and have access to the same functionality and features as a 
[Sharp App](/docs/sharp-apps) including extensibility va [custom plugins](/docs/sharp-apps#plugins). 
They can run **stand-alone** independent of an 
[app.settings](/docs/sharp-apps#ideal-for-web-designers-and-content-authors) config file, instead the app settings configuration
can be added in its page arguments to enable or configure any features.

Lets go through a couple of different possibilities we can do with scripts:

### Adhoc reports

Scripts can use the built-in [Database Scripts](/docs/db-scripts) to be able to [run queries against any](/docs/sharp-apps#multi-platform-configurations) `sqlite`, `sqlserver`, `mysql` and `postgres` database and quickly view data snapshots using the built-in
[HTML Scripts](/docs/html-scripts#htmldump), e.g:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/01.md' | githubMarkdown }}

#### Specifying Script Arguments

The above script generates a static HTML page can be invoked with **any number of named arguments** after the script name, in this case it
generates a report for Northwind Order **#10643**, saves it to `10643.html` and opens it in the OS's default browser:

    $ web run script.html -id 10643 > 10643.html && start 10643.html

Which looks like:

### textDump

Generating static `.html` pages can quickly produce reports that looks good enough to share with others, 
but if you just want to see a snapshot info at a glance or be able to share in text-based mediums like email or chat
channels you can replace `htmlDump` with `textDump` where it will instead output GitHub flavored Markdown tables, e.g:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/02.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
As the output is human-readable we can view directly it without a browser:

    $ web run script.ss -id 10643 

Which will output:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/07.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
And because they're GitHub Flavored Markdown Tables they can be embedded directly in Markdown docs (like this) where it's renders as:
{{/markdown}}

<div class='markdown-body'>
{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/08.md' | githubMarkdown }}
</div>

### AWS Dashboards

The [comprehensive built-in scripts](/docs/default-scripts) coupled with ServiceStack's agnostic 
providers like the [Virtual File System](/virtual-file-system) makes it easy to quickly query infrastructure resources
like all Tables and Row counts in managed AWS RDS Instances or Search for static Asset resources in S3 Buckets.
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/03.md' | githubMarkdown | to => md }}
{{ md | replace('&lt;<span class="pl-ent">script</span>&gt;', '<span class="pl-en">```code</span><span class="pl-s1"></span>') 
      | replace('<span class="pl-k">&lt;</span><span class="pl-k">/</span>script<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span>','<span class="pl-en">```</span><span class="pl-s1"></span>') | raw }}

{{#markdown}}
You can use `$NAME` to move confidential information out of public scripts where it will be replaced with Environment 
Variables. Then run the script as normal and optionally provide a pattern for files you want to search for:

    $ web run script-aws.ss *.jpg

Where it displays a dashboard of activity from your AWS resources: containing all Tables with their Row Counts, 
adhoc queries like your last 5 Orders, The Root files and Folders available in your S3 Bucket and any matching resources 
from your specified search pattern:

### Azure Dashboards

The nice thing about `#Script` late-binding and cloud agnostic providers is that with just different configuration we
can **use the exact same script** to query an Azure managed SQL Server Database and Azure Blob File Storage:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/04.md' | githubMarkdown | to => md }}
{{ md | replace('&lt;<span class="pl-ent">script</span>&gt;', '<span class="pl-en">```code</span><span class="pl-s1"></span>') 
      | replace('<span class="pl-k">&lt;</span><span class="pl-k">/</span>script<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span>','<span class="pl-en">```</span><span class="pl-s1"></span>') | raw }}

## Live #Script with 'web watch'

What's even nicer than the fast feedback of running adhoc scripts? Is the instant feedback you get from being able to **"watch"** the same script!

To watch a script just replace `run` with `watch`:

    $ web watch script-aws.ss *.jpg

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/sharpscript/watch-aws-azure.gif)](/docs/sharp-scripts)

The ability to run stand-alone adhoc scripts in an extensible dynamic scripting language feels like you're 
using a "developer enhanced" SQL Studio, where you can combine queries from multiple data sources, [manipulate them with LINQ](https://sharpscript.net/linq/restriction-operators) 
and quickly pipe results to dump utils to combine them in the same output for instant visualization.

`#Script` scripts can also be easily shared, maintained in gists and run on all different Win/OSX/Linux OS's that .NET Core runs on.

### Live Transformations

Another area where "watched" scripts can shine is as a "companion scratch pad" assistant during development that you can quickly switch to
and instantly test out live code fragments, calculations and transformations, e.g. This ends up being a great way to test out markdown syntax
and Nuglify's advanced compression using our new `minifyjs` and `minifycss` [Script Blocks](/docs/blocks):
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/05.md' | githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
Then run with:

    $ web watch livepad.ss

Which starts a live watched session that re-renders itself on save, initially with:

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/06.md' | githubMarkdown }}
