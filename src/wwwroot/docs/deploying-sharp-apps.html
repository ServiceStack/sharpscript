### Gist or GitHub App Server Deployments

As Sharp Apps are just .NET Core Web Apps, the same App can be run within a [Chromium Desktop App](/docs/gist-desktop-apps) with 
[app](https://docs.servicestack.net/netcore-windows-desktop), cross-platform on Windows, macOS or Linux with 
[web](https://docs.servicestack.net/web-tool) in the preferred browser or hosted on a server where it's accessible to everyone with an internet connection.

Not only does not needing to compile Sharp Apps dramatically simplify App development but it also dramatically simplifies 
App deployment where you can **completely skip all CI and build steps** as there's nothing to build or deploy with the built-in
support for Gist publishing.

All that's required is to run the App on your server with `web open <app>`, e.g. to run `redis` Gist App:

    $ web open redis

Or to "install" the Gist App (without launching it with "open") so it can be run offline locally:

    $ web install redis
    
## Deploying Sharp Apps to Ubuntu

A common way for reliably hosting .NET Core Apps on Ubuntu is to use [supervisor](http://supervisord.org/index.html)
to monitor the `dotnet` self-hosting processes behind an nginx reverse proxy which handles external HTTP requests to
your website and proxies them to the dotnet process running your Web App on a local port. You'll need access to a Unix 
environment on your client Desktop, either using Linux, OSX or 
[Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows#option-1-install-redis-on-ubuntu-on-windows).

### Setup the deploy User Account

Using a Unix command-line or [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://github.com/ServiceStack/redis-windows#option-1-install-redis-on-ubuntu-on-windows) 
ssh into your remote server:

    $ ssh deploy@web-apps.io

We'll start by creating a dedicated user account for hosting and running your .NET Core Apps to mitigate potential abuse. 
SSH into your Ubuntu server and create the `deploy` user account with a `/home/deploy` home directory and add 
them to the `sudo` group:

    sudo useradd -m deploy
    sudo usermod -aG sudo deploy

For seamless deployments use `visudo` to allow `deploy` to run `supervisorctl` without
prompting for a password:

    # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
    %deploy ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/supervisorctl, /home/deploy/.dotnet/tools/web

> In vi type `i` to start editing a file and `ESC` to quit edit mode and `:wq` to save your changes before exiting.

#### Install the dotnet `web` tool:

    $ dotnet tool install -g web

For simplifying the one-time setup, it's easier to sign-in as super user:

    $ sudo su -

#### Configure Nginx

Which runs on port `5000` by default, which you can make available under your preferred domain by adding an nginx virtual host by changing to:

    $ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/

Then creating a Virtual Host configuration for your App, which you can start from using the mix `nginx` config template:

    $ web mix nginx -name redis

Then renaming the `redis.web-app.io` file to the domain you want it hosted on instead, e.g:

    $ mv redis.web-app.io redis.your-domain.com

You'll also need to rename the virtual host in the config file, which in vi you can do with:

    :%s/redis.web-app.io/redis.your-domain.com/g

Which should look something like:

    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name redis.your-domain;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_buffering off;
            proxy_ignore_client_abort off;
            proxy_intercept_errors on;

            client_max_body_size 500m;
        }
    }

You'll also need to update the port number if you want to run your .NET Core App on a custom port.

Now to enable the site in nginx, link it with:

    $ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/redis.your-domain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/redis.your-domain.com

Then reload nginx to pick up changes:

    $ /etc/init.d/nginx reload

And voila! your Gist Sharp App is now being served at **redis.your-domain.com**

#### Configure Supervisor

We can further harden the .NET Core App process by having it run under a managed [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/index.html) process.

To do this [create a deploy User Account](https://sharpscript.net/docs/deploying-sharp-apps#setup-the-deploy-user-account) and give it
permission to run the `supervisorctl` and `web` programs, then change directory to:

    $ cd /etc/supervisor/conf.d

Then generate a supervisor configuration template with:

    $ web mix supervisor-sharp -name redis

Which should create 

    $ app.redis.conf

Which should be close to pre-populated with your App, you'll just need to change the port if you're using a custom port number:

    [program:app-redis]
    command=/home/deploy/.dotnet/tools/web run redis --release
    directory=/home/deploy/.sharp-apps/redis
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    stderr_logfile=/var/log/app-redis.err.log
    stdout_logfile=/var/log/app-redis.out.log
    environment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production,ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://*:5000/"
    user=deploy
    stopsignal=INT

> The --release flag overrides debug in app.settings so it's always run in release mode.

If you don't have [mix](https://docs.servicestack.net/mix-tool) installed you can copy the above configuration and replace references of `redis` to 
your app's name, which in vi you can do with:

    :%s/redis/acme/g

After reviewing the changes, tell supervisor to register and start the supervisor process with:

    $ supervisorctl update

Where your website will now be up and running under a managed process at: **redis.your-domain.com**

#### Deploy Updates

Now that's everything's configured, deploying app updates are easily done by installing the app again (which downloads the latest version),
then restarting the supervisor managed process, in these 2 commands:

    $ web install redis
    $ supervisorctl restart app-redis 

Which can also be deployed from the Windows Command Prompt using a remote SSH command by combining the above commands in a `deploy-spirals.sh` text file:

    ssh -t deploy@web-app.io "sudo /home/deploy/.dotnet/tools/web install redis && sudo supervisorctl restart app-redis"

Where App updates can then be performed with a single WSL bash command from the Windows Command Prompt:

    $ bash deploy-spirals.sh


### Customized App Settings

If you need to customize the App's settings, like we've needed to do with [blog.web-app.io](http://blog.web-app.io) **app.settings** to replace
its OAuth keys, you can add a modified copy in its App folder which will take precedence over the read-only gist version:

    $HOME/.sharp-apps/blog/app.settings
    
### Hosted Gist Apps

All our Gist Apps are now hosted this way, by running a locally downloaded Gist App that's hosted at the following URLs:

 - [redis.web-app.io](http://redis.web-app.io)
 - [blog.web-app.io](http://blog.web-app.io)
 - [plugins.web-app.io](http://plugins.web-app.io)
 - [spirals.web-app.io](http://spirals.web-app.io)
 - [bare.web-app.io](http://bare.web-app.io)

### Using Travis CI to deploy using Docker to AWS ECS

A popular combination for deploying .NET Core Apps is to use the online [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
Continuous Integration Service to package your App in a Docker Container and deploy it to AWS ECS which takes care of
the management and deployment of Docker instances over a configured cluster of EC2 compute instances.

The easiest way to set this up is to clone the [rockwind-aws](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/rockwind-aws)
Web App which is preconfigured with a working scripts using Travis CI to package the Web App in a Docker container 
and deploy it to AWS ECS. In your local copy replace the 
[/app](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/rockwind-aws/tree/master/app) folder with your App files, e.g:

#### [Dockerfile](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/rockwind-aws/blob/master/Dockerfile)

<p>
    The only other file that needs to change is <em>deploy-envs.sh</em> to configure it to use your App's deployment settings:
</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/rockwind-aws/blob/master/deploy-envs.sh">deploy-envs.sh</a></h4>

{{ 'gfm/deploying-sharp-apps/03.md' | githubMarkdown }}

<h4>Setup AWS ECS and Travis CI</h4>

<p>
    After configuring your App deployment scripts you'll then need to 
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs#1-create-the-ecsinstancerole-role">Setup your AWS ECS</a>
    with an EC2 instance to deploy to and 
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs#create-project-in-travis-ci">Create your project in Travis CI</a>.
    You'll then need to add your AWS Account details in the Travis CI project using
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs#ci-environment-variables">Secure Environment Variables</a>
    to store your <em>AWS_ACCOUNT_ID</em>, <em>AWS_ACCESS_KEY</em> and <em>AWS_SECRET_KEY</em> as well as any sensitive info and 
    connection strings your App uses.
